This is an implementation of Hangman, written in Ruby, for The Odin Project.

It runs on the command line, counting down six turns, which reveal an ASCII hangman on incorrect guesses.  It recognizes doubled inputs, correct and incorrect guesses, and has support for saving and loading game data.  In addition, when a game is completed, the data is deleted.
